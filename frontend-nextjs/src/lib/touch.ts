// Shared touch primitives. iOS and iPadOS run their own gestures on top of the
// page — the long-press selection callout and the selection it drags in with
// it — and they win: once the platform claims a touch it cancels ours
// mid-gesture, so a press-and-hold or a drag simply dies. Surfaces that own
// their gesture have to opt out.
//
// What the two classes below cover, precisely:
// - `-webkit-touch-callout: none` stops iOS's long-press callout. WebKit-only:
//   it is not a property other engines have, so it is inert everywhere else.
// - `user-select: none` stops the long-press selection on every engine,
//   Android included, and stops a drag from painting a selection under the
//   cursor. It is inherited, so it reaches every descendant — which is why the
//   two classes differ only in whether they apply it unconditionally.
// What neither covers:
// - Chrome for Android's long-press menu on a link or an image. No CSS
//   suppresses it; a gesture surface that wraps one needs its own
//   `onContextMenu` with `preventDefault()`.
// - The native drag of an `<img>` or `<a>` descendant. `-webkit-user-drag` is
//   not inherited and plain divs and buttons are not drag sources, so setting
//   it on the surface does nothing — the child itself needs `draggable={false}`.

/**
 * Classes for a surface that *is* the control: a thumb, a drum, a stage, a
 * handle, a hold button. Selection is suppressed on every input, because a
 * drag that highlights the control's own label is wrong on a mouse too.
 * Compose with `touch-none` when the surface also owns the scroll axis — leave
 * it off when the page must still scroll from there.

 * a scroller, a context-menu trigger, a sheet header, a list row. Selection is
 * suppressed only where the platform runs its own press gestures — a coarse
 * pointer — so a mouse user can still select and copy that content. If the
 * gesture itself would paint a selection under the cursor, add `select-none`
 * for the duration of the gesture rather than reaching for
 * `TOUCH_GESTURE_CLASS`.
 *
 * `pointer: coarse` describes the *primary* pointer and nothing else, so a
 * hybrid machine reads it wrong in both directions: a tablet with a mouse
 * plugged in keeps touch as primary and loses mouse selection, and a laptop
 * with a touchscreen keeps the mouse as primary and leaves selection live
 * under a finger. No media query can answer per interaction — the query is
 * about the device, and the question is about the gesture in progress. The
 * default stays here because it is right on the machines that are one thing or
 * the other, and losing a selection is a nuisance; where the miss costs a
 * *gesture* instead, the surface pairs it with `holdSelection` on the press.
